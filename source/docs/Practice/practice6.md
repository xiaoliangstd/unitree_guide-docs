# Practice6: posture control of robots
In FixedStand state, you only need to press **"3"** key on the keyboard
or the **"L2+X"** key combination on the handle to enter the FreeStand state.
In this state, we can use the keyboard or the joystick to control the robot to change its position and attitude in the same place. When using keyboard, we use **WASD** key to simulate the left stick of joystick, and **IJKL** key to simulate the right stick. Meanwhile, the space bar represents returning the value of the left and right joysticks to 0.
