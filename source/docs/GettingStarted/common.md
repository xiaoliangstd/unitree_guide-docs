## Robot Network
&emsp;There are three computers on the A1 robot, except for one main control board that is not open to the user.
The other two are open to the user, one of which is an X86 UP Board and the other is an ARM Raspberry Pi or TX2.
The other one is an ARM Raspberry Pi or TX2 computer, which is equipped with a switch on the robot in order to allow the three computers to communicate with each other.Then a local area network can be formed.

&emsp;The architecture of the Go1 robot is similar to that of the A1 robot, but the computing power of the Go1 robot has been significantly increased.
There are five computers in the Go1 Education Edition, starting with the same main control board as the A1, followed by a Raspberry Pi 4B and three Jetson nano computers.
The five computers are also connected to each other through a LAN with a switch.
